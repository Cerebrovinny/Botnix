# Preface {#preface}

This manual describes how to install, use and extend Botnix, a Linux distribution based on the purely functional package management system [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix), that is composed using modules and packages defined in the [Botpkgs](https://nixos.org/botpkgs) project.

Additional information regarding the Nix package manager and the Botpkgs project can be found in respectively the [Nix manual](https://nixos.org/nix/manual) and the [Botpkgs manual](https://nixos.org/botpkgs/manual).

If you encounter problems, please report them on the [`Discourse`](https://discourse.nixos.org), the [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/%23nix:nixos.org), or on the [`#nixos` channel on Libera.Chat](irc://irc.libera.chat/#nixos). Alternatively, consider [contributing to this manual](#chap-contributing). Bugs should be reported in [Botnixâ€™ GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/nervosys/Botnix/issues).
